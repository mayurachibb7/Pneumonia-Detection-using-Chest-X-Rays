In this project, we will build a Convolutional Neural Network  model which correctly classifies whether a chest X-ray image is infected with pneumonia or not. The data for this project can be downloaded from this link  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. The dataset contains normal and  infected chest X-ray images.
